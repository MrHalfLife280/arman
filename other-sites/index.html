  <h1>MrHalfLife</h1>
  <p><strong>MrHalfLife</strong> (real name <em>Arman Nitaliyev</em>, born December 8, 2011) is a German-based internet personality, amateur musician, and Linux enthusiast. Known for his low-fidelity music recordings and use of open-source software, he has developed a small online presence through music production, YouTube videos, and various aliases.</p>

  <h2>Early Life</h2>
  <p>Arman Nitaliyev was born in Heidenburg, a municipality in the Bernkastel-Wittlich district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Raised in a Kazakhstani family where Russian was primarily spoken, Arman initially struggled with the German language. He has described his early education as difficult, citing speech issues and a limited understanding of German upon entering school in 2019.</p>
  <blockquote>"If I only knew COVID-19 came after 2019, I would've been faster to figure out German."</blockquote>
  <p>He later moved with his family—including his mother and two brothers—to Aachen, North Rhine-Westphalia. There, he attended the Lindenschule in Haaren before transferring to the Hugo-Junkers-Realschule, which he criticized as “very chaotic.” In May 2025, he undertook trial lessons at the Couven Gymnasium and reportedly enjoyed the experience.</p>

  <h2>Online Presence</h2>
  <p>Arman began uploading short, low-effort YouTube videos focused on the game <em>Roblox</em>, primarily recorded from his desktop computer in Aachen. Most of these videos were lost due to an upgrade to Windows 11, which resulted in the loss of all local files.</p>
  <blockquote>"No backups."</blockquote>
  <p>His online identity evolved significantly over time. Initially using Roblox under the username <strong>arman_nita</strong>, he frequently created new accounts due to forgotten passwords, though he retained access to one of the earliest accounts, <strong>canim22</strong>, originally created by his brother. Over time, he transitioned aliases from <strong>arman_nita</strong> to <strong>munitionne</strong>, and ultimately to <strong>MrHalfLife</strong>.</p>
  <blockquote>"I noticed people were having issues pronouncing munitionne, since it sounds French, which I can understand, so after naming myself MrHalfLife, I was happy."</blockquote>

  <h2>Music</h2>
  <p>Under his earlier alias <strong>arman_nita</strong>, Arman began producing music on SoundCloud. He later abandoned the platform after suspecting that most of his followers were bots attempting to lure him into predatory label deals. He returned to music production under the name MrHalfLife, using the Linux MultiMedia Studio (LMMS) to create MIDI-based tracks.</p>
  <p>His vocals, recorded with a low-quality microphone, were initially captured at a sample rate of 8000 Hz, a detail he claimed to have discovered much later. He now records at 48000 Hz.</p>

  <h2>Linux and Technology</h2>
  <p>Arman is an avid Linux user and often experiments with open-source systems. He operates a Dell Latitude D630 running Arch Linux, a machine given to him by a cousin. Despite his enthusiasm, he acknowledges the system's limitations, particularly its malfunctioning Wi-Fi chip. On social media, he has expressed interest in acquiring a ThinkPad.</p>
  <p>Although passionate about Linux, Arman does not use it on his main computer due to software compatibility issues.</p>
  <blockquote>"I have lots of programs that just won't work on Linux. I would really like to switch to Linux. And DaVinci Resolve on Linux is ass."</blockquote>

  <h2>Musical Influences</h2>
  <p>Arman’s musical tastes span genres and decades. He has expressed admiration for artists and bands such as Rammstein, Nirvana, Blur, SDP, and the otaku-themed band MoriHime. He also enjoys novelty and retro pop artists like "Weird Al" Yankovic and C.C. Catch.</p>

  <h2>Personal Life</h2>
  <p>Arman resides in Aachen, Germany. He is politically vocal and has publicly opposed far-right ideologies.</p>
  <blockquote>"If the AfD wins an election, I will move to the Netherlands."</blockquote>

  <h2>Controversies</h2>
  <p>In 2025, Arman faced criticism over comments perceived as transphobic, related to a conflict involving the BitView community. He issued a public apology, explaining that his remarks were made during a turbulent exchange of messages and that he did not fully consider their impact.</p>
  <blockquote>"I know I have responsibility for the stuff I say online or offline."</blockquote>
  <p>He further stated:</p>
  <blockquote>"But I won't self-diagnose myself with some mental illness, because you never know if it is true or not."</blockquote>
